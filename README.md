 Project: Data-Driven Urban Planning & Smart Transportation Analytics ðŸš€
I recently worked on an innovative project focused on data-driven urban planning, specifically targeting smart transportation and pollution control. The aim was to use data analysis to improve city infrastructure and sustainability.
Hereâ€™s how I approached it:
Data Analysis: Utilized Pandas to clean and manipulate data from various sources, and NumPy for in-depth statistical analysis to understand traffic trends and pollution levels in urban areas.
Visualization: Created powerful visualizations with Matplotlib to highlight key patterns and correlations between transportation usage, traffic congestion, and air quality, offering valuable insights for decision-makers.
Web Interface: Developed an interactive, user-friendly front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enabling stakeholders to easily explore the data and make informed decisions based on real-time information.
This project was a fantastic opportunity to enhance my skills in both data analysis and web development, and I look forward to applying these capabilities to future innovative solutions!
